# AStarPathfindingRepo
The Repository was for a client

# Description
This A* Pathfinding had for objective to have the agent be able to quickly find a path from point B to multiple point B dynamically so that even after the agent calculated the 
quickest path to one point, it can be quickly re-calculated as soon as it hits an obstacle. 

## Demo

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qpMPu__iVpTm9uHfqINbZB0rHLi1-Q1F/view?usp=sharing) is a demo of what it looks like. No art assets was put into it.

## Update

This is one of the last project I've worked on. More reflexive of my latest codes.
